### Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
https://github.com/nakatsinho/agenceLab.git
```

```bash
cd agenceLab
```
2. **Dependecies:**

Navigate to the cloned repository and install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend

#### 2.1. For Back-end:
```bash
cd AgenceDashboard
```
```bash
composer update or composer install
```
##### GOOD DJOB ðŸ”¥...

Now we have the basics to test! Note that the command above brought us the following file:
- **AgenceDashboard/.env.example** - The dummy file to clone and edit the name to .env;

##### Explanation and Configuration:

Be sure to run the following commands in the root directory:
```
cp .env.example to .env
```
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=XXX-XXX-XXX
DB_USERNAME=XXXXXXXX
DB_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXX
```
Replace the above XXXXX with you own data to connect to Database. 

```
php artisan key:generate
```

#### And Hozaaaa ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥... "Ã‰ fÃ¡cil!"

Now, Just type this on you terminal from the root of backend project:
```
php -S localhost:8030 -t public/
```

This will run you backend in the following url: http://127.0.0.1:8030 

#### 2.2. For Front-end:
```bash
cd agence-client
```
```bash
npm install
```
But, this is not all! Let's call and update the line where the API's are called
- Navigate to the following folder: 
```bash
cd agence-client/src/services
```
- There you will find the file name: **http.js**
- Open it and update the baseUrl to **http://127.0.0.1:8030**

If you get success, then run the following command
```bash
npm run dev
```

Probably you will get the following url: **http://localhost:5173**, just open it in you browser and VOILAAA... ENJOY
